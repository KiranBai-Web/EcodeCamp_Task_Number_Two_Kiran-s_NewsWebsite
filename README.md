# EcodeCamp_Task_Number_Two_Kiran-s_NewsWebsite
To bring my news website to life, I followed a series of structured steps to ensure everything functioned perfectly. Here’s how I did it:

1. I Obtain My API Key
First, I signed up with a news API provider to get access to their news data. After completing the registration process, I received an API key. This key was essential for connecting my website to the news service and fetching the latest articles.

2. I Integrate the API Key
With my API key in hand, I moved on to the code. I opened my JavaScript file and located the placeholder for the API key. I replaced this placeholder with my actual API key. This allowed my website to communicate with the news API and pull in data.

3. I Design the HTML Layout
Next, I focused on the structure of my website. I set up the HTML to include all the necessary elements: a navigation menu for browsing different news categories, a search bar for user queries, and a container where the news articles would be displayed. This structure provided a solid foundation for the website’s functionality.

4. I Apply CSS Styling
Once the HTML structure was in place, I turned my attention to the styling. I updated my CSS file to include styles for both light and dark modes. This step was about making sure the website looked great and was user-friendly, regardless of the user’s theme preference.

5. I Implement News Fetching
With the styling done, I moved to the functionality. I wrote a JavaScript function to fetch news articles from the API based on different queries, such as "latest news" or "technology." This function was crucial for bringing dynamic content into my website.

6. I Display the News Articles
After setting up the fetching function, I created another function to display the news articles. Using a template, I formatted each article with titles, images, and descriptions, and dynamically inserted them into the HTML container. This made sure the news content was presented neatly and attractively.

7. I Implement Search Functionality
To allow users to find specific news, I added a search feature. I set up an event listener on the search button so that when users entered a query and clicked search, the website would fetch and display relevant news articles based on their input.

8. I Handle Navigation Clicks
To enhance user experience, I implemented functionality for the navigation menu. I wrote a function that responded to clicks on different navigation items, such as "Technology" or "Politics." This function ensured that users could easily switch between different categories of news.

9. I Add a Dark Mode Toggle
For personalization, I included a dark mode toggle. I added a switch that users could use to toggle between light and dark themes. I wrote a function to handle this toggle, changing the website’s appearance based on the user’s choice.

10. I Perform an Initial News Fetch
To ensure that users see fresh content when they first visit the website, I called the news-fetching function as soon as the page loaded. This initial fetch displayed the latest headlines right from the start.

11. I Test Everything
Finally, I conducted thorough testing. I checked each feature—news fetching, search functionality, navigation, and dark mode—to ensure they worked as expected. This testing phase was crucial for ironing out any issues and providing a smooth user experience.
